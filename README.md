This application was developed as an mobile hand guide to the story, item wiki, quest tracking and update information center.
It also provides useful links for contacting developers via E-Mail, leaving a tip or joining the Discord.

(PS. It's primarily a school project, so let's not talk about how (not) useful these things are.)
