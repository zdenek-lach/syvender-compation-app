    <string name="StoryTime_Actual_Story">It all happened so quickly, yet I cannot forget it. I was in an open field surrounded by forest. There was something underground, I felt it. I closed my eyes and tried to pull that feeling closer to me. The ground started shaking, but I was calm like I knew what I was doing. I opened my eyes and there in front of me, a tower started to build itself from some unnatural material. A moment later the tower was built and I walked the stairs to the top. There was a large obsidian statue with hollow eyes. I bowed to the statue and said: "It is ready my lord." The eyes started glowing red and the room looked even darker. Then a voice came out of the statue: "Prepare to defend this tower, someone is watching us." Immediately after that, I felt like something was pushing me out of my body. It dragged me out and pinned me against a wall. It was then when I realized that I was never there, that I was looking through the eyes of some mage, who built this tower.
\n
He looked back at the statue and said: "This one? He thinks this a dream. How much of a threat could he possibly be?"
"Right now he is the only one who knows about us."
"Don't worry about him, I will send someone to eliminate him."
"Very well, just be discreet"
\n
The mage pulled his staff by unseen power across the room to his hands, then raised it and struck the floor. At that moment I saw a large wave of arcane energy rushing against me. There was nowhere to hide from it so I just stood there frozen, and when the wave reached me, I woke up.</string>
